# Employee-Tracker

## Description
THis application uses MySQL to work with a database of employees, roles, and departments. It uses inquirer to collect user input in a straightforward way. This application could be used to keep track of employees in any company. 

In the process of building it, I learned how to use MySQL to work with databases, and about how databases function in general. I also gained more of an understanding of how to integrate node into my functions. 

## Installation
Run npm install to install the necessary node packages, and use mysql to source the schema and seeds files.

## Usage
See video walkthrough below. Use node to access the file from the command line, and then follow the prompts to add to the database. The application will automatically use your input to update the database. I added placeholder information to the seeds.sql file, but this could be replaced if desired.

## Credits
I built this application with inquirer and MySQL. I recieved some assistance in building it from my tutor, Vinnie Lopez. I used the names of people I know for the employees.
